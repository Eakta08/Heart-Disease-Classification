# Heart-Disease-Classification
This is Machine Learning project based on Classification. In this project, you will find several ML algorithm performed like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine(SVM), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN) to figure out which is the best among all and with high accuracy using scikit and statsmodel.api . I hope you enjoy it ðŸ˜Š.

The dataset consists of:
1. age - age in years
2. sex - (1 = male; 0 = female)
3. cp - chest pain type
4. trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
5. chol - serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6. fbs - (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
7. restecg - resting electrocardiographic results
8. thalach - maximum heart rate achieved
9. exang - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
10. oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12. ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13. thal - 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
14. target - have disease or not (1=yes, 0=no)
